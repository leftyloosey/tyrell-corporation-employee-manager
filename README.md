# Module 12 Challenge

## Employee Manager App

This is a node application that queries a sql database of employees and their 
names, salaries, departments, etc. Functions in the app allow the user 
to show all the departments within the imaginary corporation, show all the job
titles therein, and then the total number of employees and salary and how these 
are grouped by role and department. The user is also allowed to change the 
parameters of each individual role, or delete it entirely. In kind, they can 
also delete by employee and department. 

It uses the inquirer, mysql2, and console.table modules.
